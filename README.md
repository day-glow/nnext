## Background Story
Our teacher has a difficulty randomly selecting the next presenter. He'd ask "Alexa, pick a number between 1-n....Alexa...
Alexa, would respond "I'm sorry I didn't quite catch that".
Back and forth, until he would basically give up.
Next, he tried volunteers...crickets.
Next, he would ask someone to pick a random number between 1-n. Next, we would have to shift our numbers as each person went.
Let's just say, this is how "nnext" was born.
